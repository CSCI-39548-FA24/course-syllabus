# CSCI-395.48 - Practical Web Development <br/> Fall 2024, Hunter College
### Tuesday/Thursday, 5:30pm - 6:45pm | Online/Synchronous

---

## Course Description

This elective course is meant to introduce Computer Science students to modern day web development practices, languages, and frameworks that are in use in the industry today to do full stack web development. The course is mostly practical and hands-on to give the students as close to a real-world industry experience as possible. Students will spend the majority of the semester building web applications of varying degrees, from small assignments with initial boilerplate/template code, to building their own web app from scratch as part of a final project.

After the completion of this course, students are expected to have at least a basic understanding of how web application development works, and should be comfortable setting up a basic fullstack web-apps from scratch.

## Grading

40% - Assignments (4 x 10%) (Late submission penalties applied at 10% per week) <br/>
40% - Final (Group) Project (30%) + Group presentation (10%) <br/>
10% - Lab Report <br/>
10% - Individual Presentations/Reports/Talks <br/>

More details on the assignments/presentations below towards the end of this syllabus.

Just to be completely transparent about grades, you can calculate your final grade with the formula below:

```text
FinalGrade =
Math.floor(
    .10 * (assignment 1 grade) +
    .10 * (assignment 2 grade) +
    .10 * (assignment 3 grade) +
    .10 * (assignment 4 grade) +
    .10 * (lab report grade) +
    .10 * (individual presentation grade) +
    .40 * (final project grade)
)

*Note, calculations will be rounded DOWN*
```

The formula should be pretty straightforward to understand. Your final letter grade is based on CUNY grading ranges as outlined [here](https://hunter.cuny.edu/students/registration/records-and-transcripts/grading-structure/).

## Slack
We'll be using Slack as our primary communication platform outside our class. This is probably the best way to reach me, aside from my email/scheduled office hour meetings. I tend to check Slack throughout the day, especially if I'm at work, and will try and answer all questions/inquiries as soon as possible.

- Check our class Blackboard for the most up-to-date Slack invite link.
- Invites will not be emailed out individually, so it's import that you join our classroom Slack yourself via the link provided on Blackboard.
- Reach out to me if you run into any issues with joining Slack!

---
## Office Hours (Virtual ~30min sessions via Google Meet)

I'm usually available for a quick virtual meeting most days of the week, feel free to schedule a time with me via my appointment link below:

https://y3pio.setmore.com/

I'll send a Google Meet invite to the email you signed up with as a confirmation, or reply back to schedule a different time if it doesn't work!

### Virtual Open Office Hours

```text
Fridays, 11:00am - 3:00pm
Drop by out office hour slack channel.
```

I'll also keep an open office hour time slot, _usually_ on Fridays, if you all would like to drop by our dedicated #office-hour Slack channel to ask questions or clarification on any of the class materials/assignments.

---

## GitHub Classroom
We will be using GitHub classroom to complete our assignments. Each assignment link will be handed out via BlackBoard, which will give you access to your own personal assignment GitHub repository, where you will commit code/answers to your assignments.

As part of `assignment0` (not graded), you will be required to properly set up your GitHub account, and join our GitHub classroom.

## Virtual/Online Course Info

### Note/Disclosure

This semester will be my first semester teaching this course as a **_fully online/synchronous_** course. As such, we may be prone to adjusting/tweaking some of our course structure, materials and sessions as needed.
Additionally, I'll also be going through a few big life changes this semester (expecting a baby soon!), and may have unexpected emergencies that I'll (hopefully won't) have to attend to, but in any case if such situations do come I'm, I'll be sure to communicate this with the class beforehand!

### Virtual Classroom Etiquette

As with any fully online course/classroom, we should adhere and follow some common virtual classroom etiquette below:

- Do be mindful of your surroundings during lectures, try and attend lectures in a quite and focused environment.
- Please be mindful of our mics/audio input and keep ourselves muted until we need to unmute.
- Try not to speak out of turn, use the hand raising tool wait to be called upon before joining in on the vocal discussions.
- Texts/class chatroom on the other hand is highly encourage and open to free participation.
- Webcams are optional, but would definitely encourage ya'll to have them on when possible to make the virtual classroom more engaging.

Lastly, please do be respectful towards each other, and keep all discussions/conversations/topics in a civilized manner.

### Lecture Streams, Recordings & Slides
Lectures will be streamed on BlackBoard Ultra classroom tool. I've had some latency issues with this in the past, trying to live stream the in-person class lectures and record at the same time, so recordings will be done directly on my machine using QuickTime to do a screen capture.

As a backup, if the above setup does not work, we will fall back to using Google Meet as an alternative if needed.

Lecture room/links will be posted on BlackBoard and/or Slack shortly before the start of our class.

Current set of slides will be posted/added to a shared Google Drive folder, and made available throughout the course.

---

## Course Technical Specs/Standards
Since there are many different web browsers/engines out there, each with their own standards and interpretation of what the web specs should be, 
we as a class should agree on a spec/standard and stick to it throughout the course for everything that we do (i.e lecture demos, assignments, final project, etc...).

For this course, we will be sticking to the below browser/NodeJS versions, upon which your assignments/projects will be graded against.

```
Browser: Google Chrome - any recent update/version should suffice
NodeJS: v18.20.4 (Hydrogen) or +
```

Any additional libraries that we bring in should satisfy these two standards (i.e work on Chrome, run on NodeJS 18).

## Individual Presentation

Aside from your final presentation, you are also required to present an individual presentation for 10% towards your final grade. The web dev field is one that's always evolving, with new technologies/frameworks being adopted every day, and to be good web devs, we often need to stay on top of the latest trends in the field.

As part of your presentation, you can give a short ~5-10 min talk/report on what are some of the interesting changes that are happening in our field. This can be anything from a new framework that you picked up, a new JS library, or new technologies being developed that impacts the internet/web dev field.

We will devote the start of the class session (limited to 3 presentations max per class) to presentation, sign up sheet link will be posted on BlackBoard, and are on a first come first serve basis!

Just to give an outline on what's expected in your presentation, consider the points below:

- What is your presentation on? Is it a new framework/library that you found? Bugs that you encountered? Latest news in the web dev world?
- Why is this topic important to our field, and how does it impact our work?
- How does it address/cause certain issues that we find on the web?

Example slides of a small presentation on a bug fix that I did for work: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Vvj5eyRQE3oOiBYAFOQsP3ZBjVL53Np1XdLEqxG1QE/edit?usp=sharing

- You can keep it much shorter than this example!
- Doesn't have to be about a bug fix.
- You can also supplement your slides with an actual demo/code/recording.
